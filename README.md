# ServerStatistic

This project is meant for my learning of Swift and SwiftUI. 

## Aim
- This app is aimed for getting a quick look at the Hardware Utilization (CPU, Disk, Memory) of configured remote servers. 
- This app requires a specialized server script running on the end server. Refer `Extras/server.py`.

## Usage
- For the server, do `pip install fastapi uvicorn psutil` and run the server.py script.
- For build instructions, I'm Working on it.
